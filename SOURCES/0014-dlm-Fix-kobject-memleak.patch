Subject: [PATCH 14/14] dlm: Fix kobject memleak

Currently the error return path from kobject_init_and_add() is not
followed by a call to kobject_put() - which means we are leaking
the kobject.

Set do_unreg = 1 before kobject_init_and_add() to ensure that
kobject_put() can be called in its error patch.

Fixes: 901195ed7f4b ("Kobject: change GFS2 to use kobject_init_and_add")
